# Your solution goes here.

1.List append: O(1), constant complexity
2.List prepend: O(n), linear complexity
3.Characters append: O(n), create a new string with n+1 char,
    linear complexity
4.Retrieving value from a dict: O(1)
5.Appending a bit to integer: O(1), "bitwise operations are very very fast"
6.Changing a bit in an integer: O(1)
