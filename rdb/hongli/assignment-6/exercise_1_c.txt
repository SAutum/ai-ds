Like SQL injection, the website takes all the info in the comments as
HTML language.

I injected a script which generates an alert and the hacked website will
show the message I wrote:

<script>
alert('Congrats! You just win our $1000! Please contact our customer service ASAP: 4008008820')
</script>
