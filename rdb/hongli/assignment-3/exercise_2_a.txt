- additive: sales revenue of a company ABC of a product chess in a day
    The sales revenue can be summed up through time (week, month, year
    ), product (chess, boardgames, games) as well as company ('ABC', board game
    manufacturers, ...) in all dimensions in this 3-dimensional model.
- semi-additive: number of people present in a class of a day
    The number is additive through classes, grades, etc, but in the
    dimension of time, summing up number  people present in the class
    in a week does not make sense unless we take avarage.
- non-additive: opening price of a company of a day.
    The summed opening price in a week or over several companies is
    meaningless. The fact is not additive in any dimensions.
