- Sorting phase: the best worst case time complexity for sorting without
prior knowledge is in O(klog(k))
-> O(mlog(m) + nlog(n))

- Joining phase:
each tuple in both relations is visited at least once for checking matches
O(m + n).
additionally, for k tuples, the algorithm iterates over their columns to
add to the result O(kc)
-> O(kc)
So in total -> O(mlog(m) + nlog(n) + m + n + kc) = O(mlog(m) + nlog(n))
