- a: a Christmas tree, an evergreen conifer with decorations

- b: Grid File, data space is partitioned by grids into cells, which
    form several regions.

- c: like a B+ tree, a B tree structure with sequentially linked leaves.
    But the tree here is not a balanced one (a level missing on the right)
  e: a B tree.

- d: K-D-B tree, a page is cutted by ranges of two attributes and stored
    into a B-tree (not shown)
  f: like a K-D-B tree, but the page shall be partitioned into rectangles,
    there is an L shape in this example and no ranges could cut the page
    into that shape.

- g: cube, it's a cube with each dimension subdivided into non-overlapping
    intervals.

- h: R-tree, several regions of nodes on the same level are overlapping
