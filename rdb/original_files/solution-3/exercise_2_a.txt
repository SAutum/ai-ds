Additive facts can be summed over all dimensions (location, time, category, etc.). Examples are:
    - Sales
    - Revenue
    - Profit

Semi-additive facts can be summed over some dimensions, but not others, for example:
    - Number of a specific kind of physical object (apples, oranges, shoes, cars, etc.)
        - Adding objects over time does not make sense.
        - Adding objects over different stores/locations is usually fine.

Non-additive facts can not be summed, or at least the result does not make sense.
    - Percentages or ratios (e.g. mean)
        - Percentages usually can not be summed directly if the thing they are relative to changes (e.g. total vs relative number of sales per month).
    - Median
    - Standard deviation
    - IDs
    - PINs
