# BEGIN_SOLUTION

Drill-Down operations give us a more detailed data cube.
If we drill down twice, we go from "month" to "hour".
Roll-Up moves us up the hierarchy.
Rolling up four times, we arrive at "year".
Then drilling down thrice and rolling up twice, we arrive at "quarter".
There are four quarters in a year, so the answer is:

4

(Some people also consider the aggregated sum over a dimension as an additional
subcube, in which case we'd have thirteen subscubes in the initial arangement
and five in the final state.)
