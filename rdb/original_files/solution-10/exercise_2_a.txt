(a) is a Christmas tree. You can tell it is a Christmas tree because the way it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs&t=62s

(b) is a grid file (evenly spaced grid with pointers to pages).

(c) is not a B+ tree because it is not balanced (leaf nodes have different
distance to root node)

(d) is a K-D-B-Tree, as this structure can arise from recursive subdivision of
a rectangle.

(e) is a B tree (no linked leafs, which would make it a B+ tree, balanced,
nodes with m + 1 children)

(f) might appear like a K-D-B tree at first glance, but contains a concave
region in the bottom-left quadrant, which disqualifies it. So this is nothing
in particular.

(g) is a data cube. You can tell because of the cubes. Alternatively, this can
also be a 3D grid file without pointers to pages.

(h) is an R-tree (rectangular nodes with rectangular subnodes)
