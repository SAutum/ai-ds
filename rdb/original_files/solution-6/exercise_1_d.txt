# BEGIN_SOLUTION

All user input must be sanitized, for example by escaping it with `html.escape`,
which will replace the characters '&', '<' and '>' with '&amp;', '&lt;' and
'&gt;'. The browser will not interpret the escaped sequences as code.

(html.escape also escapes single quotes and double quotes, which is not relevant
since we are not inside a quoted HTML attribute value.)

Another solution are render templates, which are escaped by default:
