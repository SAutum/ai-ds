# BEGIN_SOLUTION

The attribute `customer.firstname` is being selected, but `firstname` does not
appear in the GROUP-BY-statement. This is not allowed according to the SQL 92
standard.

Depending on the database, this query might either be rejected or it might
return an undefined first name if two customers have the same last name if
the database is sloppy (e.g. SQLite).

This is a violation of the Fail-Fast principle:
