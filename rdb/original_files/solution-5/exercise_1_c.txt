# BEGIN_SOLUTION

The first loop to build the index has a complexity of O(n * c) because
there is one operation for each row and each column element.

The outer nested loop is visited m times and the middle nested loop is entered
k times. The inner-most loop contributes a factor of c to get O((m + k) * c).

Combining both gives a total complexity of O((n + m + k) * c).

k can not be simplified, because the output may be n * m rows long in the case
of a cross product, which is more than n + m.
