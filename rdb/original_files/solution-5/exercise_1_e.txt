# BEGIN_SOLUTION

- Tables may already be sorted or there might be a B-Tree index to help.
- If a user wants a sorted result, it needs to be sorted anyway.
- For very large relations, the hash index might not fit into memory. In this
    case, the hash index would be written to disk. Reading it back into memory
    would be slow. However, for merge joins, there are efficient sorting methods
    which do not require that the entire relation is in RAM at the same time.
