# Your solution goes here.
We can use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
In this case, we can change the original code to the 
 # Check password
cursor.execute("SELECT username FROM bird WHERE password = ? AND username = ?",(password,username)).
By this way, the database treats user inputs as data rather than the SQL command.
