The easiest way I've found to somehow prevent XSS attacks is to use Python's built-in html.esccape module for escaping. We can import the escape from html, it can replace escaping html characters in a string, for example it can replace < with &lt and > with &gt. And we need to change the code from 
"<div class="tweet-text">
        {tweet_text}
</div>" 

to

"<div class="tweet-text">
        {escape(tweet_text)}
</div>".
