# Notes

- Communication happens via __RocketChat__
- There are sheets and projects.
- All submissions are done in Jupyter notebooks and Python.
- __Deadline:__ 23:59 before the day of the discussion (no extensions)
- __Submission format:__
    - Submit __a single zip file__
    - The file should be named by the __IDM__ of __all participating__ students, separated by __underscore__. For example `idm1_idm2.zip`.
    - Submissions that do not follow the naming convention might not be considered if our scripts fail to detect them.
    - __Sciebo__ links to upload files will be provided upon handing out the exercise (typically in the notebook).
    - Include everything that is required to run your solution in the ZIP.
    - Make sure your submissions work by restarting and running the notebook kernel once before submission!
    - Submit executed notebooks. This helps us to see your results, and maybe errors. If you need "weird" software, include a note on how to install things.
- Sheets should be submitted individually. Projects can be done by groups of at most two people.
- Submission have to show effort overall. Not everything has to work, but if something does not work, we expect documentation. We need so see that you actually tried.
- A submission from everybody for all exercises is __mandatory to be eligible for the exam__.
- During the discussion, we ask groups to __present their solutions__.
- If you have problems, __talk to us!__ Use the Q&A. We are happy to help if you are struggling, but you have to become active and contact us.

__Contact:__

You can contact us via RocketChat, but for urgent (time-critical) questions, consider writing a mail.
In all cases, include both of us in the mail communication, to account for vacation/sick leave.
