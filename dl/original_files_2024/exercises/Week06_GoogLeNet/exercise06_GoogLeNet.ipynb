The GoogLeNet architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that was proposed by Szegedy et al. in 2014. The architecture is known for its use of `inception modules`, which are modules that perform multiple convolutions with different filter sizes and then concatenate the results. The architecture also uses `auxiliary classifiers` to help with training.\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the implementation and there will be the following subtasks you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the Inception module (1 points)\n",
    "2. Implement the auxiliary classifier (1 point)\n",
    "3. Implement the BabyGoogLeNet architecture (2 point)\n",
