When comparing two versions of PyYAML—5.3.1 in the pyyaml1 environment and 3.13 in the pyyaml2 environment—we notice distinct behaviors. Specifically, the 5.3.1 version raises a warning when calling yaml.load() without specifying the Loader parameter, emphasizing a security concern. This warning is not present in the older 3.13 version.

Upon further investigation, we learned that this warning was introduced starting from version 5.1 of PyYAML. To highlight the differences between these two environments, a diff comparison of pyyaml1.yaml and pyyaml2.yaml files shows:

yaml
Copy code
diff pyyaml1.yaml pyyaml2.yaml 
1c1
< name: pyyaml1
---
> name: pyyaml2
8c8
<   - pyyaml=5.3.1
---
>   - pyyaml=3.13
This confirms that the pyyaml1 environment is using a more recent version of PyYAML compared to pyyaml2.
