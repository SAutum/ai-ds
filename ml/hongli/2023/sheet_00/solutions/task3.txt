By using diff we may find:

diff pyyaml1.yaml pyyaml2.yaml 
1c1
< name: pyyaml1
---
> name: pyyaml2
8c8
<   - pyyaml=5.3.1
---
>   - pyyaml=3.13

That in environment pyyaml1, the version for pyyaml is newer than which in pyyaml2. 
The new version raises a depreciation warning while running example = yaml.load(ex).
