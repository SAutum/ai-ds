This is the repository for the AI&DS study group. All the solutions of the exercises might be synced here.

Current members are:
- Hongli Lin (kag52rer)
- Linbo Zhang (luy28gey)
- Shoucheng Ling (ziq34mun)

Each folder represents a course of study:
- ap: Advanced Programming and Algorithms I & II
- dl: Deep Learning
- math4ai: Mathematical and Statistical Foundations of Data Science
- ml: Machine Learning
- dlrl: Deep Learning: Representation Learning
- asa: Algorithms for Sequence Analysis
- cv: Computer Vision
- mc: Markov Chains
- rl: Reinforcement Learning

Furthermore, each member has his/her own subfolder under each subject (e.g. ap/shoucheng). The individually solved problems can then be put in the corresponding folder.

The subfolder "original_files" contains the original files downloaded from ILIAS. It is currently maintained by Hongli Lin, and will be updated as soon as possible.
